# Forensics 50 (Solved)

Problem: "Is kill can fix? Sign the autopsy file?"

Solution: File is a corrupted `.pcapng`.  It will not open in Wireshark or tcpdump.  File is readable in text editor.  Used `file_search.py` to find the flag.

Flag: `flag{roses_r_blue_violets_r_r3d_mayb3_harambae_is_not_kill}`
